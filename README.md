### Hello, World! 👋 

I have been developing web sites and mobile applications for twenty years. I experiment with low-power computing, build mechanical keyboards, and contribute to Open Source software. I use React, monorepos, Behavior Driven Development, and Dev-Ops integrations, to engineer user interfaces that scale across multiple teams and products.

- 🔭 I’m currently developing user interfaces for autonomous vehicle company, [isee.ai](http://isee.ai)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Ethereum Blockchain Development with Solidarity](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with long-term maintenance of [React Workspaces](https://github.com/react-workspaces/react-workspaces-playground)
