# Hello, World! 👋

**PROFILE:**
I have been developing websites for 20 years, and hybrid mobile apps for 8 years. I have been instrumental in applying monorepos, cloud platforms, BDD, and DevOps to build architecture that empowers multiple engineering teams to ship a wide array of products with a unified methodology. I have led web engineering teams through the scaling journey from initial implementation, to serving the majority of K-12 classrooms in America.
