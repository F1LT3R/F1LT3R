I have been developing web sites and mobile applications for twenty years. I experiment with low-power computing, build mechanical keyboards, and contribute to Open Source software. I use React, monorepos, Behavior Driven Development, and Dev-Ops integrations, to engineer user interfaces that scale across multiple teams and products.
