## 👤 Profile 

I have been developing sites and hybrid mobile apps for over 20 years. I have used Monorepos, Cloud, BDD, & DevOps to build platform architectures that enable a wide range of products to be deployed with a unified methodology. At HMH I led five engineering teams across three countries, from initial implementation of the platform, through scaling up to the majority of K-12 classrooms in the USA.
